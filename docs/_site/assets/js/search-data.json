    "content": "Search Set up search Generate search index Enable search in configuration Hiding pages from search Just the Docs uses lunr.js to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates. All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page). By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points: Page title Page content Page URL Set up search Generate search index Before you can use search, you must initialize the feature by running this rake command that comes with just-the-docs: $ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init This command creates the search-data.json file that Jekyll uses to create your search index. Alternatively, you can create the file manually in the assets/js/ directory of your Jekyll site with this content: {% raw %} { {% for page in site.html_pages %}{% if page.search_exclude != true %}&quot;{{ forloop.index0 }}&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;{{ forloop.index0 }}&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;{{ page.title | replace: &#39;&amp;amp;&#39;, &#39;&amp;&#39; }}&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;{{ page.content | markdownify | strip_html | escape_once | remove: &#39;&#39; | remove: &#39;&#39; | remove: &#39;&#39; | replace: &#39; &#39;, &#39; &#39; | normalize_whitespace }}&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;{{ page.url | absolute_url }}&quot;, &quot;relUrl&quot;: &quot;{{ page.url }}&quot; }{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %} {% endif %}{% endfor %} }{% endraw %} Note: If you don’t run this rake command or create this file manually, search will not work (or it will use the search index data from this docs site, not your site’s content). Enable search in configuration In your site’s _config.yml, enable search: # Enable or disable the site search search_enabled: true Hiding pages from search Sometimes you might have a page that you don’t want to be indexed for the search nor to show up in search results, e.g, a 404 page. To exclude a page from search, add the search_exclude: true parameter to the page’s YAML front matter: Example layout: default title: Page not found nav_exclude: true search_exclude: true",
